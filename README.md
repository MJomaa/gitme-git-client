# Introduction

Version-Control Client Application with Angular 8 and Electron (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v8.0.2
- Electron v5.0.2
- Electron Builder v20.41.0
- node-pty@0.9.0-beta20
- xterm 3.14.5

The application was based on the from [*maximegris* 's bootstrap application](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron)

This application is not fully tested and only for reference purpose. Be aware that any further issues might not be resolved.

/!\ Angular 8.0 CLI needs Node 10.9 or later to work.

## For Study purpose

The project is used as the final project for university course. The works in the application was done with lots of help from:

- [DesignCourse video](https://youtu.be/Ea2lWsumTrM) that provide knowledge about ElectronJS in just 1 hour (actually I just need 15min as the rest is coding in Angular).
- [Maximegris and his awesome bootstrap application repo](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron).
- Tyriar with his fast and detailed support on node-pty [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/issues/337).
- [Visual Studio Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) where I can find the correct `package.json` config (damn node-pty@0.9.0-beta19)
- Mrs.Duong who is the lecturer and gave me tons of advise in managing development process.
- [JVB corp](http://jvb-corp.com/en/) where I work, especially my boss Mr.T who helped me a lot in technical issues despite I disappointed him a lot in company project lol.
- And many more...

## Thank you all for helping me graduate!!!
